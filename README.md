# 🧬 Bioinformatics Playground

Welcome to the **Bioinformatics Playground** — a space to explore, practice, and refresh bioinformatics skills through hands-on coding challenges. This repository focuses on solving problems from the [Rosalind platform](http://rosalind.info/), with solutions organized by domain to promote better understanding and reusability.

## 📚 What is This?

This project is a personal learning environment to:

- Reinforce fundamental bioinformatics concepts
- Practice coding with real-world biological data
- Build a structured set of solutions across key domains
- Learn algorithms relevant to biology and genomics

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The repository is organized by bioinformatics domains:

- **Genetics**: DNA, RNA, transcription, translation, Mendelian inheritance  
- **Algorithms**: Recursion, probability, dynamic programming  
- **String Algorithms**: GC content, pattern matching, sequence alignment  
- **Graph Theory**: Overlap graphs, trees, genome assembly graphs  

Each domain has its own module and corresponding tests.
